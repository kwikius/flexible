match algorithm for alternatives


// both start symbols are same
// then the second matcher is redundant
// dont need to warn
// except maybe for optimisation
m1 = 'a' | "ab" ;
m2 = "ab" | 'a' ;

m1 == m2 = true;

match(m , 'a' )  == true

both above should work the same way

m = "ab" | "abc";
m = "abc" | "ab";

also means  | | should be a sequence

match(m, "ab") == true

// matchers will be removed once failed
m = 'a' . 'c'  | "abc";
// return first that succeeds?

skip one character
